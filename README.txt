Holy Angels Public School — Website package
==========================================

Files:
- index.html           : Main website file (modern, minimal)
- assets/styles.css    : CSS for the website
- assets/brochure_placeholder.txt : Placeholder for brochure PDF you can add later
- assets/images/*      : Put real images here to replace placeholders

How to use:
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Upload the entire folder to your hosting (GitHub Pages: push to a repo and enable Pages from the root; Firebase Hosting: set public to folder and deploy; or any static host).
3. Replace placeholder images in assets/images and brochure_placeholder.txt with real files (rename to brochure.pdf).
4. Edit contact info or add phone/email directly in index.html.

Quick GitHub Pages steps (if you want):
- Create a public repo.
- Upload files to repo root (index.html at root).
- Settings → Pages → Source: main branch / root → Save
- (Optional) Add custom domain under Pages settings and add DNS A records as GitHub Docs instructs.
